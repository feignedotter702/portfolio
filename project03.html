                      <p class="card-text">React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used by many companies and developers around the world to create efficient and scalable web applications. </p>
                      <p class="card-text">There are several reasons why people use React for web development. One of the main reasons is that React allows developers to create reusable components, which can make it easier to build complex and scalable user interfaces. Additionally, React uses a virtual DOM, which can improve application performance by reducing the amount of time it takes to update the view when the state of the application changes. Finally, React has a strong ecosystem, with a large community of developers and a wide range of third-party libraries and tools that can be used to extend its capabilities. </p>
                      <p class="card-text">
                        In this project, we will be using React to develop a movie database website that allows users to search for and view information about their favorite movies. The website will feature a clean and intuitive design, and will be powered by a powerful interactive feature that will enable users to quickly and easily find the movie they are looking for. We believe that by using React, we will be able to create a website that is fast, user-friendly, and capable of handling a large amount of data. We are excited to get started and are looking forward to creating a valuable resource for movie fans everywhere.

                  <p class="card-text">
                    Having a "My Favorite List" function on a movie database website can improve the user experience in several ways. 
                    First, it can allow users to easily save and organize the movies they are interested in, making it easier for them to keep track of which films they want to watch and to access this information quickly in the future. 
                    This can be especially helpful for users who have a large number of favorite movies and want to be able to easily access and manage this information.
                  </p>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    Second, a "My Favorite List" function can provide users with personalized recommendations based on their favorite movies. For example, the website can use the information in a user's favorite list to suggest similar films that they might be interested in. This can help users to discover new movies that they might not have considered otherwise, and can make their browsing experience on the website more enjoyable and effective.

                          The usability principle I considered here was to make the sorting and filtering as simple to understand and use as possible. I designed the website so that the user can easily find what genre they want to use to filter the movie list and which property they want to sort the movie by so that they can easily find the most ideal movie.
The sorting and filtering bar does not scroll with the movie list, making it easier to use.
The user can select the number of movie tickets to purchase and then click submit to add the film to their favorites. They can also change the quantity and remove the movie.

                The sorting by year or by score is in the sorting block and remains on the left bar, as do the filters by genre and rating, which remain as the user scrolls down the movie list.
The middle of the movie card list's body contains a movie image, movie information, and an add-to-favorites feature. On the right side of each movie card, there is a button that allows you to change the quantity and add it to your favorites list.
By clicking on the My favorites section at the top right of the page, the user can see what is in their favorite list.

                    <p class="card-text">I have ListComponent representing the movie card list, and OperationComponent representing the sorting and filter operations when selected on the left navbar. The ScoreList component calculates the total score added to the favorite.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">The props pass down from the app to the sub-component using a function like setSort, setGenre. The function is implemented in the sub-component with useEffect.</p>

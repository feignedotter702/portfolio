                      <p class="card-text">I choose the kiosk at MacDonald as the accessible interface for this project. MacDonald is somewhere people go to for a quick meal or when they want something late in the night. I observed and interviewed people using the kiosk to order food and check out. After interviewed three people, I come out with the persona and the storyboard. </p>
                      <p class="card-text">A McDonald's ordering kiosk is a self-service terminal that allows customers to place their orders without interacting with a human cashier. The kiosk typically features a touch screen display that customers can use to browse the menu, select items, and customize their orders. Customers can then pay for their orders using cash, credit cards, or mobile payment services, and the kiosk will print out a receipt with the order details. The kiosk may also offer additional features, such as the ability to redeem coupons or place orders for pickup at a later time. Overall, McDonald's ordering kiosks are designed to provide a convenient and efficient way for customers to place their orders.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Do you think itâ€™s more efficient to order on the kiosk than go to the front desk ordering with a waiter?
                    <p>
                    <p class="card-text-sub">
                        - Most users said they use kiosk instead of ordering at the counter 
                         for kiosks allow customers to place their orders quickly and efficiently, 
                        without having to wait in line to speak with a cashier. 
                        This can be especially useful in McDonald because there are many customers and only a limited number of cashiers available to take orders. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text-sub">
                        - Additionally, kiosks can be used to provide customers with more information about the products or services being offered, which can help them make more informed decisions about their purchases.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text-sub">
                        - Finally, kiosks can be more convenient for customers who may not be comfortable speaking with a cashier or who prefer to place their orders independently.
                    </p>

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Can you find what you want conveniently? Do you think the automated card reader is easy to use?
                    <p>
                    <p class="card-text-sub">
                        - The kiosk is easy to use, and the interface provides the food information without much confusion. You can find the food you want under the right category and the picture annotation is clear. The card reader is also pretty straight forward to use. It's very intuitive to insert the card when you see the card slot.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Is there any confusing prompt from kiosk that makes it hard to get right what you want?
                    <p>
                    <p class="card-text-sub">
                        - Most users are very fimiliar with McDonald's food so there are not really any misleading prompt on the menu. However some user says too much option under one category or too much custmize option makes him spend more time deciding.
